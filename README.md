GLOBAL FISHING WATCH PROJECT

The project was done as part of John Bryce' Data Science course,
focuses on build Machine Learning models using Python.
Global Fishing Watch is a Flask application that receive relevant data from the user and returns the prediction
for vessel activity in the sea.
Training data is being collected using Selenium from a public governmental site.
The prediction model used is Random Forest Classifier.
Prediction is classification of '1' for 'Fishing Activity' and '0' for 'Not Fishing Activity'.
Model accuracy is 98%.

Prerequisites:
Python3
Docker application

Instructions:
1. Clone this project
2. Create a main directory for the project
3. Create a subdirectory name 'fixtures', this is a shared subdirectory
4. There are 3 folders:
    4.1 Crawling for data collection
    4.2 Collector for model training
    4.3 Forecast for the model prediction
5. Each folder has its own README file instructing how to run the code in docker
6. please follow instructions and find out what is the real intention of a specific vessel at sea

GOOD LUCK!
